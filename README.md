# Overview of Project
Creating VBA Macro for a client who wants to analyzing 2017 and 2018 Stock datasheet to see volume and return rate. Additionaly refactoring the code for improvement.

## Result
1. On 2018 only ENPH and RUN stocks has positive return. [2018 Result](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG)
2. On 2017 All Stocks has positive return except TERO. [2017 Ressult](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.PNG)
3. Original VBA run time has significally reduced. [2017 Origianl VBA](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_2017_Original.PNG) **VS** [2017 Refactored VBA](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.PNG), [2018 Original VBA](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_2018_Original.PNG) **VS** [2018 Refactored VBA](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Challenge_2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG)
### Summary for Refactoring
- Refactoring code would be improve the code in many ways such as efficiency, clarity, readability and so on. 
- **BUT** refactoring code can consmue lots of time and effort to improve, and the improvement might not effective as much as expected. For example a Macro runs 1 sec, and after spending days on the code Macro runds now 0.5 sec. Saving 0.5 Sec was worth to do as spending **DAYS**? The answer could be depends on cases, but definielty this should be one of factor that need to be consider when we do **Refactoring**

### Summary for our VBA
- There was a signficant reduce on Original VBA run time and readability as refactoring the code 
- It is good to have a nice, neat and clean code for reading and run usually but if the code will be used once a year I do not think we need to spend time to make improvement on the code.
